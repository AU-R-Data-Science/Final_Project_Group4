## Package Overview

This R package contains functions designed to perform logistic regression on a user's chosen response and predictor data. This is done through estimating the coefficient vector $\beta$ and which contains response and predictor data and the intercept. This is done using the function
$$
\hat{\beta}\::=\underset{\beta}{\operatorname{argmin}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-y_{i}\cdot\ln(p_{i})-(1-y_{i})\cdot\ln(1-p_{i}))
$$
where
$$
p_{i}\::=\frac{1}{1+exp(-x_{i}^{T}\beta)}
$$
